# FirstLab-Shapes

ef
This is the first BlueJ lab. 

It has TWO BlueJ Projects in it. Both are germain to the Chapter 1 in the doc folder.
You will follow the chapter first in `Shapes` and then in `Picture`.

__BUT__ you need to open these projects, NOT the ones that came with your BlueJ download. Use
`Project -> Open Project...` to find your `dev/FirstLab-Shapes` folder. Open `Shapes` there. (and the same is
for `Picture`).

Be sure to 

* FORK this repository to your own account.
* CLONE your version of the repository into your dev directory.
* For the first section of the lab, open the BlueJ project file Shapes/project.bluej from Finder.
* For the second section, use Picture/package.bluej

Object of lab is to follow the chapter reading the doc folder. (and Draw a House!)

Can you draw a house with a tree along side? (think `trunk` and `circle` or a tall, skunny `triangle`.
